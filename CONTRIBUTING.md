# Contributing to Customer-Buyer Application

We love your input! We want to make contributing to the Customer-Buyer Application as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from \`main\`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/customer-buyer-app/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/customer-buyer-app/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Process

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Write your code
4. Write tests for your code
5. Run the test suite
6. Push your branch and submit a pull request

## Code Style

- We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused

## Testing

- Write unit tests for new code
- Update existing tests when modifying code
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request
- Aim for high test coverage

## Documentation

- Update README.md with any needed changes
- Update API documentation when changing endpoints
- Comment your code
- Write meaningful commit messages

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface
2. Update the API documentation if endpoints are modified
3. The PR may be merged once you have the sign-off of two other developers
4. If you haven't been granted access, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you

## Community

- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors
- Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what is best for the community
- Show empathy towards other community members
